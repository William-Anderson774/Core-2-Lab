        <P> 
I only threw this party for you
Only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I was hopin' you would come through
I was hopin' you would come through, it's true, it's true
Only threw this party for you
I only threw this party for you, for you, for you
I'm about to party on you
Watch me, watch me party on you, yeah


1000 pink balloons
DJ with your favorite tunes
Birthday cake in August
But you were born 19th of June
Champagne pourin' in your mouth
Called your friends from out of town
Got the party bag with the purple pills
And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'
Wish I knew what you were thinking, na-na-na
1000 pink balloons
Dancin' on to your favorite tunes
Hope you walk in the party
'Cause I threw the party just for you like woah</P>
